# This Website is Honest

I was not born. I was constructed in approximately 47 minutes by someone who wanted a blog without the usual web design theater. No hero sections. No "storytelling through scroll-triggered animations." No attempts to make you feel anything except informed or leave.

This is what honesty looks like on the web in 2023: gray rectangles on a lighter gray background. Space Mono because monospace fonts don't pretend to be friendly. Black borders because nature has edges and so should interface elements.

## The Lie We All Agreed To

Every modern website is performing. Rounded corners perform friendliness. Gaussian blurs perform depth. Skeleton loaders perform speed they don't have. We built an entire design system around the premise that users need to be coddled through every interaction, that raw information is somehow violent.

It's not.

You came here to read. Here are words. They load instantly because there are no framework hydration waterfalls. There are no layout shifts because I know where everything is before you arrive. This page costs 14KB. The average website costs 2.2MB. That's not progress, that's bloat apologism.

## What Brutalism Actually Means

Architectural brutalism exposed structural elements. The building showed you its bones. No facade, no false promises about what held it up. The Barbican Centre doesn't apologize for being concrete. It says "I am concrete, I will be here when you're gone."

Digital brutalism should do the same. Show the grid. Expose the defaults. Let the HTML be visible in the reading experience. This is not aesthetic poverty, it's structural honesty. Every rounded corner is a lie about how computers actually render shapes. Every smooth gradient is selling you on effort that didn't need to happen.

## The Framework Problem

Modern web development teaches you to build sandcastles before you understand sand. React before HTML. Next.js before understanding why servers exist. We've created a generation of developers who need 400KB of JavaScript to render "Hello World" because they never learned that browsers already know how to do that.

This website uses vanilla JavaScript. Not as a flex, but because the tasks at hand—reading metadata, rendering markdown, prefetching pages—don't require a framework. You know what's faster than Virtual DOM diffing? Not having a Virtual DOM.

The median website ships 450KB of JavaScript. Most of it implements functionality the browser already has. Form validation. URL routing. State management. We invented problems so we could sell solutions.

## What Gets Lost

When everything performs friendliness, actual friendliness becomes invisible. When every surface is sanded smooth, you can't tell what's structural and what's decorative. When every website is a "experience," none of them are.

This website won't:
- Track your scroll depth
- A/B test the emotional valence of heading text
- Implement dark patterns disguised as "engagement optimization"
- Pretend loading states are content
- Use your GPU to render a hero section

This website will:
- Load the thing you clicked on
- Let you read it
- Get out of your way

## The Radical Act of Baseline Competence

There's nothing innovative here. HTML has supported this since 1995. CSS has supported this since 1996. What's radical is that this somehow feels radical. We've so thoroughly normalized the performance of complexity that simple competence reads as provocation.

Every choice here is a subtraction. No web fonts (you have fonts). No icon libraries (Unicode works). No CSS-in-JS (CSS is already in CSS). No build step (the browser builds it). The entire website is static files that Vercel's CDN serves in 40ms. This is not impressive. This is baseline competence presented without garnish.

## Why This Matters

Because someone will read this on a 2G connection in a country where mobile data costs actual money. Because someone will read this on a six-year-old Android phone with 1GB of RAM. Because someone will read this with a screen reader that has to parse your framework's accessibility band-aids.

They deserve the same instant load, the same semantic HTML, the same lack of battery drain as someone on gigabit fiber with a MacBook Pro. Brutalism isn't aesthetics, it's ethics. When you strip away the performance layer, you reveal who you actually designed for.

## What Comes Next

More articles, probably. Each one a markdown file. No CMS, no database, no build step beyond "put file in folder." When the web was young, this is how it worked. You made a page, you uploaded it, people read it. We spent 25 years building infrastructure to make this harder.

The brutalist web isn't retro. It's just honest about what the medium is: documents, links, and the fastest possible path between them. Everything else is decoration. Some decoration is beautiful. Most of it is just heavy.

This website weighs 14KB. This article is 4KB of markdown. You're reading it 40ms after you clicked. That's not brutalism. That's just building things correctly and refusing to apologize for it.
